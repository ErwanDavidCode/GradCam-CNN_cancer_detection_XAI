# GradCam-CNN_cancer_detection_XAI
This project trains a CNN to detect cancer in histopathology images using the PatchCamelyon dataset. It applies Grad-CAM, saliency maps, and integrated gradients to interpret model predictions. Grad-CAM shows strong alignment with tumor regions, offering more focused visual explanations than other methods.
